In this repository, we adapt the Atalay (2017) intersectoral DGE / intertemporal CGE model to the Australian economy. The result is a fully intertemporal model of the Australian economy that resembles the Australian Treasury's Intersectoral Model (TIM). In contrast with both Atalay (2017) and TIM, our solution is global as opposed to local. That is, instead of log-linearising around the steady state, we use value function iteration to obtain the full solution. Our solution methods, and in particular our Python version, build on Scheidegger and Bilionis (2019).
